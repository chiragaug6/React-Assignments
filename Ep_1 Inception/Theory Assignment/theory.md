QUE.2 =>Difference between a Library and Framework?

ANS:
A library is like a toolbox with diffrent tools that you can use to bulid things. you choose which tools you want to use, and you are in control of how you use them to build your project.

A framework, on the other hand, is like a set of blueprints for building a specific type of project, such as a house. The framework provides a structure and a plan for how to build the project, and you need to follow its plan and rules to build the project correctly. You still have some control over how you use the framework, but it provides more guidance and structure than a library.

QUE.8 => What is async and defer?

ANS:
the "async" attribute allows the script to be downloaded and executed asynchronously, while the "defer" attribute
ensures that the script is downloaded in the background and executed only after the HTML document has finished parsing. These attributes can be useful for optimizing the performance of web pages by controlling the loading and execution of external JavaScript files.
